          HTML Canvas Graphics




Q. Which of these must you do in order to draw shapes or write text on a canvas?

Ans. Access the context of the canvas (ctx)


When you make the Canvas and assign width and height. Then when you work in its 'Context' 
in 2D. So all the methods will work only inside the assign width and height.

The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics on a web page.

The graphic to the left is created with <canvas>. It shows four elements: a red rectangle, a gradient rectangle, a multicolor rectangle, and a multicolor text.




What is HTML Canvas?
The HTML <canvas> element is used to draw graphics, on the fly, via JavaScript.

The <canvas> element is only a container for graphics. You must use JavaScript to actually draw the graphics.

Canvas has several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and adding images.



Canvas Examples
A canvas is a rectangular area on an HTML page. By default, a canvas has no border and no content.

The markup looks like this:

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100"></canvas>

Note: Always specify an id attribute (to be referred to in a script), and a width and height attribute to define the size of the canvas. To add a border, use the style attribute.

Here is an example of a basic, empty canvas:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="100" style="border:1px solid #000000;">
Your browser does not support the HTML canvas tag.
</canvas>

</body>
</html>




Add a JavaScript
After creating the rectangular canvas area, you must add a JavaScript to do the drawing.

Here are some examples:

<script>
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.moveTo(0, 0);
ctx.lineTo(200, 100);
ctx.stroke();
</script>
